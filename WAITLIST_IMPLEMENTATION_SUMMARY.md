### üöÄ API Endpoints

#### User Endpoints
```
POST   /api/waitlist/join/{classSessionId}         - Join waitlist
DELETE /api/waitlist/leave/{entryId}              - Leave waitlist  
POST   /api/waitlist/confirm/{entryId}            - Confirm promotion
GET    /api/waitlist/my-entries                   - View user entries
```

#### Admin Endpoints
```
GET    /api/waitlist/class/{classSessionId}       - View class waitlist
GET    /api/waitlist/class/{classSessionId}/stats - Waitlist statistics
POST   /api/waitlist/admin/promote/{entryId}      - Manual promotion
GET    /api/waitlist/audit/{classSessionId}       - Audit trail
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

```properties
# Hold window duration
gym.waitlist.hold-window-minutes=30

# Maximum waitlist size
gym.waitlist.max-position=100

# Cleanup settings
gym.waitlist.cleanup-hours=24
gym.waitlist.promotion-batch-size=10

# Feature toggles
gym.waitlist.enable-auto-promotion=true
